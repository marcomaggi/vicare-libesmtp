1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of C and Scheme libraries for
Vicare Scheme,  an R6RS compliant Scheme  implementation; it
provides bindings for the libESMTP C language library.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested libESMTP version 1.0.7rc1.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Before  installing  Vicare/libESMTP  make  sure  to  have  a
correctly installed libESMTP library and Vicare Scheme.

  To install Vicare/libESMTP from  a proper release tarball,
we must unpack the archive then do:

   $ cd vicare-libesmtp-0.1.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that the  "configure" script  is prepared  to enable
shared libraries and disable static libraries: this must not
be  changed, because  the package  is meant  to install  a C
shared library to be dynamically loaded.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/vicare-libesmtp

  If,  instead, we  have  checked out  a  revision from  the
repository, we  will have to first  build the infrastructure
running a script from the top source directory:

   $ cd vicare-libesmtp
   $ libtoolize
   $ sh autogen.sh

after this the procedure is the same as the one for building
from a proper release tarball.

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

		  $(libdir)/vicare-scheme

  After  installation, the  makefile rule  "vfasl-installed"
will  precompile the  libraries installed  in the  hierarchy
(vicare mail libesmtp ---); the makefile rule "installcheck"
will run the test suite against the installed libraries.
